# Cards

## Usage

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.
They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.
The Card component consists of the card itself, the card body and an optional card title.

### About

A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.

### Content types

Cards support a wide variety of content, including images, text, list groups, links, and more.
Mix and match multiple content types to create the card you need, or throw everything in there.

### Sizing

Cards assume no specific width to start, so theyâ€™ll be 100% wide unless otherwise stated.
